# Productivity System Guide & Rules

## Overview
This guide explains how the productivity points, streaks, levels, and badges work in the Sigla-Track app.

## Points System
- **Daily Completion**: Each habit completed today earns **10 points**.
- **Streak Multipliers**:
  - 3+ day streak: **1.5x** points per completion (15 points)
  - 7+ day streak: **2x** points per completion (20 points)
- **Streak Reset**: If a habit is not completed today, its streak resets to zero.
- **No Category Bonus**: All habits, regardless of category, earn the same points.

## Leveling Up
- **Level Calculation**: Every **500 points** earned increases your level by 1.
- **Badges**: You earn a new badge for each level:
  - Level 1: Newbie
  - Level 2: Rising Star
  - Level 3: Achiever
  - Level 4: Pro
  - Level 5: Master
  - Level 6+: Legend LvN (N = level number)

## Progress Display
- **Total Points**: Only your overall points are shown (not per habit or category).
- **Streaks**: Streaks are tracked for each habit and affect your points multiplier.
- **Levels & Badges**: Your current level and badge are displayed on the dashboard.

## Example
- Complete 1 habit today (no streak): 10 points
- Complete 1 habit today (3-day streak): 15 points
- Complete 1 habit today (7-day streak): 20 points
- Reach 500 points: Level up and earn a badge

## Regulations
- Only habits completed today count for points and streaks.
- Streaks are lost if a habit is missed for a day.
- Points and levels are cumulative and never decrease.
- Badges are awarded automatically upon leveling up.
